Challenge 1 (SkinCancerClassifier) -> How to get the confusion matrix 
Solution 1 -> Getting the of predicted label and actual label to a list and parsing for metric.configuration


Challenge 2 (SkindDiseaseClassifier) -> Getting the images renamed / resized / Gray Scaled
Solution 2 -> Image Preprocessing

Challenge 3 (SkinDiseaseClassifier) -> Creating the np array along with the labels
Solution 3 -> Created a secondary .py file named 'SkinDiseaseClassifier2' and had an iterator run over to append both resized array and label

Challenge 4 (SkinDiseaseClassifier2) -> Validation accuracy not increasing with epochs & Validation Loss increases. 
Solution 4 ->
